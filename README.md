# Adam Wright — Astro Site (Markdown‑first)

A lightweight personal site you can edit with simple **Markdown** files in `src/content/sections/`.

## Edit content
- Open any `.mdx` file in `src/content/sections/`.
- Use plain Markdown. Reorder sections by renaming files with a leading number (e.g., `01-`, `02-`).

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build & deploy
- Deploy to **Netlify** or **Vercel** (zero config for Astro).
- Or use **GitHub Pages** via an action.

## Optional: visual CMS
If you want a no-code editor, add **Decap CMS (Netlify CMS)** later; I can wire this up so you can edit via a secure admin URL with Git commits under the hood.
