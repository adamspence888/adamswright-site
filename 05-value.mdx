title: "Value‑Based Approach"
---

I use a structured value framework after incubation & qualification:

1. Identify business need/opportunity in the current state and **quantify** its impact  
2. Co‑define the target state and the path to get there  
3. Articulate **measurable gains** for all audiences (client, exec, legal, finance, technical)  
4. Build trust, map influence and risk, maintain urgency, communicate efficiently  
5. Close the loop with references and continuing relationships
